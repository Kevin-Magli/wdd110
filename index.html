            <p>Hello, it's good to have you here! My name is Kevin and i'm a BYU student. I live in São Paulo, Brazil, and so that you could know something about me, i like to play video-games, watch movies and series with my family, play the piano and find new music to create the perfect soundtrack for my life. My family consists of me, my father, my mother and my sister(which is my best friend) and also my cat Nico and my cute girlfriend! I've been studying programming since last year, and it's as stressing as it's cool hahaha. I also have a job as Tech Support on a glass factory called Wheaton. I provide all sorts of help in the notebook exchange area and its being very cool. I hope you'll have a wonderful time here at my page! </p>

            <p>The picture above is what i like to call "The Brazilian Times Square". A place with many buildings where people go for shopping, walks, work, everything imaginable. For me and my family, it's a place we like to go once in a while to get a good old Mc Donalds and walk on the streets hearing about my father's early work stories. It is trully a beautiful place full of important memories.</p>
