            <p>Hello, it's good to have you here! My name is Kevin and i'm a BYU student. I live in S達o Paulo, Brazil, and so that you could know something about me, i like to play video-games, watch movies and series with my family, play the piano and find new music to create the perfect soundtrack for my life. I hope you'll have a wonderful time here at my page!</p>

            <p>The picture above is what i like to call "The Brazilian Times Square". A place with many buildings where people go for shopping, walks, work, everything imaginable. For me and my family, it's a place we like to go once in a while to get a good old Mc Donalds and walk on the streets hearing about my fathers early work stories. It is trully a beautiful place full of important memories.</p>
